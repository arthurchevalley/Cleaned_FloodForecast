# Results
Multiple approaches were tested by varying the RNN model, creating more complex architectures and changing the variety of data given.
## _Simple_ RNN
Two RNNs were evaluated: an LSTM model and a GRU model. This section compares their results with the multiple data splits.

### LSTM Results
